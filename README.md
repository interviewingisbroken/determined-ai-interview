Each round of Determined AI's interview

1st Round: Phone screening with hiring manager.

2nd Round: A one hour React live-coding technical screen with an engineer (find code here: https://github.com/interviewingisbroken/webui-coding-challenge)
  - The exercise is essentially to work with an existing React app that has a table with filter inputs over each column. You need to debug the app and add in the missing filter logic and implement a debouncing function for the filters.

3rd Round: A four hour virtual onsite. 
  - 1st interview: Another one hour React live coding exercise with an engineer. You will have a pre-built React app where you will have to build out a page using the Github API. Code found here (insructions are in the README): https://github.com/interviewingisbroken/determined-ai-react-onsite
  - 2nd + 3rd interview: These two are both system design interviews lasting for an hour each. The first conversation is with an engineer and is more high level/theoretical. The 2nd hour is with the same engineer but with a product manager sitting in. Both hours revolve around the same theoretical problem outlined in the "system design" markdown file in this repo.
  - 4th interview: The last hour is a conversation with the hiring manager regarding past experience and typical behavioral questions about how you handled past projects, worked with coworkers, as well as your highlights/lowlights.

After those 3 rounds, the hiring manager will call you regarding an update in a few days. They do not send rejections over email, so don't get your hopes up regarding follow up phone calls.
